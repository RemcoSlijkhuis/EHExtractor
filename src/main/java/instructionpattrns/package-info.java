/**
 * Contains classes for instruction patterns as implemented by EHExtractor, providing functionality for matching such patterns with actual instructions.
 * 
 * <p>The package name 'instructionpattrns' is not a typo. After introduction of the terminology 'instruction patterns' for this functionality in EHExtractor
 * it was discovered that Ghidra has something called 'instruction patterns' as well. Renaming the EHExtractor package to 'instructionpatterns' caused
 * all sorts of strange errors, so it was decided to go with the current name.
